Package: h5mread
Title: A fast HDF5 reader
Description: The main function in the h5mread package is h5mread(), which
	allows reading data from an HDF5 dataset into R, similarly to what
	the h5read() function from the rhdf5 package does.
	In the case of h5mread(), the implementation has been optimized to
	make it as fast and memory-efficient as possible.

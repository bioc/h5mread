- Add multithreading capabilities to h5mread().

- Make h5mread(..., as.sparse=TRUE) natively return an SVT_SparseArray rather
  than a COO_SparseArray object.

- Resume work on h5summarize().

- The reshaping operation that is currently performed by
  h5mread_from_reshaped() should instead be implemented as a
  delayed operation on DelayedArray objects.
